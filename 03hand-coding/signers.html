        a character you love makes the process more fun.</dd>

      <dt>Budgeting and Planning</dt>
      <dd>Decide how much you're comfortable spending. Cosplay can be done on any budget by mixing DIY, thrifted pieces,

      <dd>Whether sewing from scratch, commissioning, or combining clothing pieces, this is the heart of cosplay. Props
        and accessories bring your character to life.</dd>

      <dt>Wigs and Makeup</dt>
      <dd>A wig and some makeup can transform your look instantly. Even simple contouring can make a big difference in
        matching your character's style.</dd>

      <dt>Confidence and Comfort</dt>
      <dd>Your costume should be something you can wear proudly and comfortably for hours. Feeling confident matters
        just as much as how it looks.</dd>

      <dt>Photography and Presentation</dt>
      <dd>Take pictures of your work, even casual ones. Photos help you see your progress and share your cosplay with
        others.</dd>
