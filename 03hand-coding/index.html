        <h1>My Journey</h1>
        <h2>From Hobby to Passion: My Cosplay Story</h2>
        <p>Cosplay first came into my life when I was sixteen, and at the time it was just something <em>fun</em> I
            wanted to try. I never imagined it would grow into such a <strong>big part</strong> part of who I am today.
            Over the years I've spent countless hours sewing, crafting, and learning new skills, and while it can be
            challenging, the end results always make the effort worthwhile. What started as a simple hobby has become a
            passion that continues to inspire me, push me creatively, and connect me with an amazing community of people
            who share the same love for bringing characters to life.</p>
        <p>As I grew more confident in my cosplays, I realized that what I enjoy most is not just wearing the costume
            but also sharing what I've learned along the way. Every mistake, every late-night fix, and every small
            victory has taught me something valuable. Now I want to pass that knowledge on to others who are just
            starting out, so they can feel encouraged, avoid some of the struggles I faced, and discover the same joy
            that made me fall in love with cosplay.</p>

        <h2>The stages of my cosplay journey so far:</h2>

            <li><strong>Sharing my work</strong> - experiencing the excitement of conventions and online communities.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Giving back</strong>wanting to share my knowledge so others can enjoy the journey too.</li>
